## Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load dataset

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

# Description of dataset

This dataset includes variables for the name of the species and island, and values related to bill, flipper, body mass, sex, and year.

There are 344 rows and 8 columns.

I can find the mean flipper length.

The mean flipper length is: `r mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = T)`

## Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x)

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()

ggsave("./scatterplot.pdf")
```


ggsave


## Export your  scatterplot to  project directory using ggsave
